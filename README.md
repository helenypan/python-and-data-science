## Course  1: Introduction to Data Science in Python
This course focuses on data manipulation and cleaning techniques using the popular python pandas data science library and introduces the abstraction of the DataFrame as the central data structure for data analysis. The course will end with a statistics primer, showing how various statistical measures can be applied to pandas DataFrames. By the end of the course, students will be able to take tabular data, clean it, manipulate it, and run basic inferential statistical analyses.
